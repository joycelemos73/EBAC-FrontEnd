<h3>üì≤ Responsiveness</h3>

The News Portal has been developed with a focus on responsiveness. This means that the web page adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring an optimal user experience.<br />
Whether you're accessing the portal from a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone, the layout will adjust accordingly, providing readability and usability.<br />

The responsive design includes:<br />

  ‚Ä¢ Fluid layout: The elements on the page resize proportionally to fit the screen, ensuring content remains visible and accessible.
        
  ‚Ä¢ Mobile-friendly navigation: On smaller screens, the navigation menu transforms into a mobile-friendly dropdown menu, allowing easy access to different categories.
        
  ‚Ä¢ Flexible media: Images and other media elements adjust their size and placement to maintain a visually appealing layout on different devices.
        
  ‚Ä¢ Media queries: CSS media queries have been utilized to apply specific styles and layout adjustments for different screen sizes, optimizing the user experience across devices.<br /><br />

  <h3>üåê Plugins</h3>

  The web page includes a reference to the <a href="https://jquery.com/download/">jQuery library</a>, enabling the smooth opening and closing of the menu button.<br />
  This is achieved by using a jQuery function to assign a click event to the button, triggering a slide toggle effect on the menu element for a seamless user experience.
